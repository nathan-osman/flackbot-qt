## FlackBot Qt Host

This application provides a Qt application that acts as a host for the FlackBot JavaScript code.

### Building the Application

The following items are required to build the application:

 - CMake 2.8.9+
 - Qt 5.1+
 - C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, and MSVC++ supported)

To build the application, create an empty directory named `build` and run CMake:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

After the Makefiles are generated, run the appropriate make command for your platform (usually `make` or `nmake` on Windows).
